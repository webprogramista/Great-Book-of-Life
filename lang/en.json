    "name": "I. The Second Coming of Christ - Third Time of Revelation",
    "chapter_1": {
      "name": "Chapter 1 - In Anticipation of the Return of Christ",
      "I_title_1": {
        "name": "Introductory view of the salvation process",
         
          "I_1": "1. In the beginning of times the world lacked love. The first humans were far from feeling and understanding that Divine Power - that essence of Spirit, the origin of all creation.",
          "I_2": "2. They believed in God, but they attributed only power and justice to Him. Men believed to understand the Divine Language through the elements of nature; therefore, when they saw it mildly and peacefully, they thought that the Lord was in agreement with the works of men; but when the forces of nature were unleashed, they thought to see in it the wrath of God, which manifested itself in this form.",
          "I_3": "3. In the hearts of men had formed the idea of a terrible God, who carried anger and the feeling of vengeance within himself. Therefore, when they thought they had offended God, they offered Him burnt offerings and sacrifices in the hope of reconciling Him.",
          "I_4": "4. I tell you that those offerings were not inspired by love for God: it was the fear of the Divine Justice, the fear of punishment, that drove the first peoples to pay tribute to their Lord.",
          "I_5": "5. They called the Divine Spirit simply God, but never Father or Master.",
          "I_6": "6. It was the patriarchs and the first prophets who began to make man understand that God was righteousness - yes, but perfect righteousness, that he was above all Father, and as Father loved all his creatures.",
          "I_7": "7. Step by step, mankind slowly wandered along the path of spiritual development, continuing its pilgrimage, changing from one age to another and learning more of the Divine Mystery through the revelations that God gave to his children at all times.",
          "I_8": "8. Yet man did not attain full knowledge of Divine Love, for he did not truly love God as a Father, nor was he able to feel in his heart the love that his Lord always showed him.",
          "I_9": "9. It was necessary that perfect love should become man, that the \"Word\" should incarnate and take on a body touchable and visible to men; so that they might finally know how much and in what way God loved them.",
          "I_10": "10. Not everyone recognized the presence of the Father in Jesus. How could they also recognize him, since Jesus was humble, compassionate and loving even to those who insulted him? They thought God was strong and proud toward His enemies, judgmental and terrible to those who insulted Him.",
          "I_11": "11. But just as many rejected that word, so many believed in his word which penetrated to the innermost part of the heart. That way of healing suffering and incurable diseases only with a caress, a look of infinite compassion, with a word of hope. That Father's instruction, which was the promise of a new world, of a life full of light and justice, could no longer be erased from many hearts, which understood that this divine man was the truth of the Father, the Divine Love of Him whom men did not know and therefore could not love.",
          "I_12": "12. The seed of that supreme truth was sown forever in the heart of mankind. Christ was the sower and he still tends his seed. Afterward he will bring forth his fruit and rejoice in it forever. Then he will no longer say in his words, \"I am hungry\" or \"I am thirsty,\" for at last his children will love him, as he has loved them since the beginning.",
          "I_13": "13. Who speaks to you about Christ, disciples? He himself.",
          "I_14": "14. It is I, the \"Word\" that speaks to you anew, mankind. Know Me, do not doubt my presence because of the inconspicuousness in which I show myself. With Me there can be no pride.",
          "I_15": "15. Recognize Me in my way of life in the world at that time, remember that I died as humbly as I was born and had lived. (296, 4- 16)"
        },
        
      "I_title_2": {
        "name": "Hopes and expectations",
  
          "I_16": "16. After my parting in the \"second time\" my return was expected from generation to generation among those who kept the faith in me. The Divine Promise was passed on from parents to children, and my word kept alive the longing to experience my return.",
          "I_17": "17. Each generation believed to be the most gifted in the expectation that in them the word of their Lord would be fulfilled.",
          "I_18": "18. And so time passed, and generations passed, and my promise became more and more suppressed from the hearts, and people forgot to watch and pray. (356, 4-5)",
          "I_19": "19. The world is being tested, the nations feel the whole burden of my righteousness falling upon them, and my light, my voice calling you, is being felt in all mankind.",
